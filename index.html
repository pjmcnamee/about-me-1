            <h2>Did you know?</h2>
            <p>George was only 7 years old when he wrote code for the first time. He was just playing on his mom's laptop while spending the day at his grandmother's house. He was always so fascinated by video games that mirrored the real world, even if the world he was playing in was fictional.</p>
